/**
 * How wide a Show Text line is, and how wide it is allowed to be.
 *
 * The default is a **character count** — 55 per line, 38 with a face — which is a
 * reasonable estimate for the stock RTP font and needs no configuration. It is only
 * ever an estimate, though, and a project whose font is not the default gets it wrong
 * in one of two directions:
 *
 * - a **narrower** font makes it warn on lines that fit comfortably. One real 8-bit
 *   project was wrapping to about two thirds of its usable width because of this, and
 *   ended up with a dozen standing false positives nobody could act on.
 * - a **wider or larger** font makes it stay silent on lines that genuinely overflow:
 *   38 characters of a 24px glyph is 912px in a 616px window.
 *
 * No single character limit fixes both, because glyph widths in a proportional font
 * span a wide range — measured on that project, `.` is 4.88px and a capital 13px, a
 * 2.7x spread — so a limit strict enough for capitals is far too strict for prose.
 *
 * So a project may supply **pixel metrics** instead: a per-character advance table
 * and the window's real usable width. Then the check is exact rather than estimated.
 * See `loadProjectTextMetrics` in `tools/projectConfig.ts` for where the table comes
 * from, and the README for the config file shape.
 *
 * Pure: no I/O. The active metrics are installed by the caller (see
 * {@link setActiveTextMetrics}); every function here also takes them explicitly so
 * tests never depend on ambient state.
