/**
 * Block-structure validation for event command lists — the check that looks at
 * how commands relate to each other, rather than at one command's parameters.
 *
 * Three vanilla commands open a *block* that later rows must close, all written
 * by the editor at the **same indent as their opener**:
 *
 * - **102 Show Choices** → one **402 When [choice]** per choice (optionally a
 *   **403 When Cancel**), closed by **404 End Choices**
 * - **111 Conditional Branch** → an optional **411 Else**, closed by **412 End**
 * - **112 Loop** → closed by **413 Repeat Above**
 *
 * The builders in `events/commandBuilders.ts` always emit these correctly; a
 * *hand-built* list (or one stitched together from fragments) is where they drift
 * — and the resulting page is broken in ways the per-command checks can't see: an
 * unclosed 102 swallows the rest of the list, a 402 whose index doesn't match its
 * slot makes that choice do nothing, an orphan 412 desyncs the editor's display.
 *
 * Pure — no I/O. Bad *pairing* is reported as `severity: 'error'` (structural, so
 * it refuses a write via `assertWritable`); findings that are merely dead-code or
 * cosmetic stay advisory.
